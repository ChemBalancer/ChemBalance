# Chem Balancer (Next.js + Tailwind)

An interactive chemistry equation balancer designed for learning—no auto-solve, only instant feedback.

## Quick start

1) Install Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/

2) Unzip this project, then in a terminal inside the folder run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3) Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Notes
- Supports parentheses and hydrates like `Ca3(PO4)2` and `CuSO4·5H2O`.
- Real-time element counts for each side, with a diff table.
- You can type inline coefficients (e.g., `2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O`).
